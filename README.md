# MyShortcutsX

One of the features I used heavily in Windows 10 (and earlier) was the ability to have custom toolbars. The toolbars provided quick access to various files and
folders. With this ability lacking in Windows 11, I wanted a small utility that could provide similar functionality. MyShortcutsX is my utility provide quick access 
to files and folders via a content menu on an icon in the system tray. 

Fancy, no, not big a long short. It is still a work in progress.
